-Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The client was looking to modernize their operations and needed security expertise about how to protect their organization from external threats and wanted the most current and effective software to do so.

-What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Once I found my client's software secutiry vulnerabilities I was able to thoroughly recognize and areticulate what needed to be done in order to address these security vulnerabilities. I updated the systems and made sure to use quality, secure coding practices to ensure not only the functionality but the security of the system as well. Security, especially in today's world, is of the utmost importance when it comes to any company's wellbeing because a security breach, depending on how severe, could be a massive burden on the clients and mean the end of the company itself. By ensuring the company's systems are secure, their name and brand can be seen as trust worthy and dependable to customers and thus increase their customer base and value as a secure company.

-What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The part about the vulnerability assessment that I founda little challening was identifying all of the false positives. I was able to identify most but was unsure on some and the exact way to tell for sure if they were false positives. 

-How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

By running dependency checks and identifying any obvious security vulnerabilities I am able to quickly and efficiently gain insight into how to mitigate the security risks. Getting as many of these out of the way by updating systems and components is a quick and easy first step. It is important to also analyze and identify the operations of the company and their systems to better understand what risks may be involved with their business. In this case, I updated the systems and added excellent encryption for the system which mitgated many of the security threats in this specific situation.

-How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I first ran dependency checks and updated all systems and components and refactored the code to impliment any and all security additions such as the encryption. After refactoring the code, I ensured that there were no errors and that all functionality was working properly and as intended. After this I ran another dependency check and with thorough analysis of the test results I was able to check whether I introduced any new vulnerabilties. 

-What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Doing the coding for encyrption and generating certificates and running the dependency checks were all very helpful and are tools that I know I will need and use in the future.

-Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I think the best thing to show future employers from this assignment is that I understand how encryption works and how to decide on the proper encryption. Also my coding skills and knowledge could be demonstrated from this assignment as well. My understanding and experience throughout this course will be invaluable and the documentation I created is evidence of my learning that can be used as a certificate of sorts for any future employer.
